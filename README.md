# differentiatoR
differentiatoR is an R package designed to analyze RNA-sequences data during stem cell differentiation, identifying and visualizing key up- and down-regulated genes across timepoints, while providing insights into associated promoters and inhibitors, enabling precise control of future gene expression with minimal off-target effects.

### Description
A paragraph that describes the purpose of your R package and biological data being analyzed.
Explain how your package add to or improve a current work flow in bioinformatics or computa-
tional biology (i.e., how is it unique?, what issue does it address?). Finally, include the R version
(not RStudio version) and platform (Mac, Windows, Linux (Debian, Fedora/Redhat, Ubuntu)),
used to develop the package. You may obtain this information by running utils::sessionInfo().
There should be no Shiny implementation at this point.
