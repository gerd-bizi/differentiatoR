\title{Perform Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering}
\usage{
performClustering(counts, method = "PCA", n_components = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{A normalized counts matrix (genes x samples).}

\item{method}{The dimensionality reduction method: "PCA", "tSNE", or "UMAP".}

\item{n_components}{Number of components to reduce to (default is 2).}
}
\value{
A data frame with reduced dimensions for each sample.
}
\description{
This function performs PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP on normalized counts.
}
\examples{
raw_counts <- matrix(rpois(100, 10), nrow = 10)
normalized_counts <- normalizeCounts(raw_counts, method = "TMM")
dr_results <- performClustering(normalized_counts, method = "UMAP")
}
